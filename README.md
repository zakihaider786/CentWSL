# CentWSL
CentOS on WSL (Windows 10 FCU or later)
based on [wsldl](https://github.com/yuk7/wsldl)

### This project is discontinued.

### Why
CentOS 8 Stream has been released, but it does not provide a raw container image.

Distributions based on another image already exists, so we recommend using them



### Alternative
Here, we introduce the RHEL-like wsldl distributions.
* [CentOS-WSL](https://github.com/mishamosher/CentOS-WSL) (by [mishamosher](https://github.com/mishamosher)) : CentOS based on qcow2 image
* [FedoraWSL](https://github.com/yosukes-dev/FedoraWSL) (by [yosukes-dev](https://github.com/yosukes-dev)) : Fedora on WSL
* [RHWSL](https://github.com/yosukes-dev/RHWSL) (by [yosukes-dev](https://github.com/yosukes-dev) : RedHat UBI on WSL
